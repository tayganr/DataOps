# Environment Setup
In this lab, you will create a Form Recognizer service and a Azure Storage Account. We recommend keeping both in a new and unique resource group, this will make it easier to delete at the end of the workshop.
## Step 1 - Create a Form Recognizer Service
1. If you have requested access to the Form Recognizer service and your access request has been approved, click the embedded Azure Portal link. Once logged in, you will be presented with the resource creation screen.
