# Environment Setup
In this lab, you will create a Form Recognizer service and a Azure Storage Account. We recommend keeping both in a new and unique resource group, this will make it easier to delete at the end of the workshop.
## Step 1 - Create a Form Recognizer Service
1. If you have requested access to the Form Recognizer service and your access request has been approved, click the embedded Azure Portal link.
