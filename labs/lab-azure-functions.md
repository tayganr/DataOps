# Lab 3 - Azure Functions
In this lab, we will look at how we can start to interact with the Form Recognizer API programmatically using Python code samples and how we can host that logic in a serverless environment using Azure Functions. This will be immensely valuable in subsequent labs as we look to operationalise, analyzing forms upon arrival in our Azure Blob Storage account (event driven architecture).
